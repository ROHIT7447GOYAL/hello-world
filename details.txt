https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1916158307686875356

I led the development of data extraction and transformation processes using Python and SQL, enabling real-time customer profile updates and dynamic segmentation. I designed and implemented comprehensive loyalty programs, incorporating targeted discounts, promotions, and rewards to drive customer engagement across various channels. Additionally, I managed omnichannel marketing campaigns through a self-service platform, optimizing communications and customer interactions. By leveraging performance dashboards and reporting tools, I continuously monitored and optimized program effectiveness. I successfully launched and operationalized loyalty initiatives that strengthened customer relationships and aligned with business goals.

    ques query


    You want me to scan at least 100 sources across alteast 100 different domain sites.

The goal is to collect and rank 100 Python interview questions specifically for Data Engineers with 10+ years of experience.

Focus only on Python-related data engineering topics (e.g., ETL, pipelines, pandas, NumPy, Spark, performance tuning), from interviews conducted in the past 3 years.

You want only the questions, ranked by frequency of appearance—no answers.

Output should be delivered in a Word document. count write frequmcy ciount in bracket..

Absolutely!

 Here's the revised list with the 5 new items integrated:

    No stress: (high importance, difficult to quantify)
    Eat whole foods: (25-30%)
    No food after sunset (Intermittent fasting): 25-30%
    2 liters of water: 20-25%
    7-8 hours of sleep: 20-25%
    30-minute walk: 20-25%
    Strength training: (15-20%)
    No caffeine: 10-15%
    No outside food: (highly variable effectiveness)
    Sunlight exposure: 10-15%
    15-minute meditation: 5-10%
    No sugar: 5-10%
    Manage screen time: 5-10%
    "Green time": 5-10%
    20-minute Diamond pose (Yoga): 5-10%
    2 glasses of buttermilk: 5-10%
    Practice self-compassion: 5-10%
    Find a joyful activity: 5-10%
    Fruit & nuts: 5%
    Social connection: 5%
    Mindful moments: 5%
     Posture and stretching
-----------------------------------------------------


Instead of a single ranking,

Sauna Use ###

 we can group items into tiers of similar importance:

    Tier 1: Foundational Habits (These would be your non-negotiables)
        No stress
        Eat whole foods
        No food after sunset
        2 liters of water
        7-8 hours of sleep
        30-minute walk
        Strength training
    Tier 2: Important Boosters
        Sunlight exposure
        No caffeine
        Meditation
            3 of your chosen new items
    Tier 3: Valuable Extras
        No sugar
        No outside food
        Manage screen time
        "Green time"
            2 of your chosen new items
    Tier 4: Positive Additions
        All remaining items (Diamond pose, buttermilk, fruit & nuts, social connection, etc.)

How to Use This:

    Focus on Tier 1: Make these the core of your health routine.
    Incorporate Tier 2 gradually: As your foundational habits solidify, add items from Tier 2.
    Tier 3 & 4 are flexible: Dip into these when you have the time and energy. Don't feel pressured to do them all at once.

Example: Let's say your main focus is stress management and overall wellness. Your 5 additions from the new list could be:

    Mindful eating
    Regular checkups
    Stretching and mobility
    Acts of kindness
    Learn something new

Let me know your priority areas and chosen additions, then I can provide a sample tiered list!

Swap your EMAs to 5 / 13 / 21.

Move your entry filter to a 5-min or 15-min timeframe instead of daily.

Implement the Alert-Candle breakout logic with a strict volume uptick.

Drop MACD & ADX if you want their “pure price-action” approach—those are PoS enhancements, not core.

trciks :- when stock up 6% buy extra -2.5 premium produt 


need to check PE value when drop..

straegy :- start with long call -6 to 5% with postivive premium with diversed profile  then profit goes up 6% then buy short call -3% to 2% with 1 CE premium and one day expiry in case of loss decicee selll ort retain...

short summary

buy with max 6 % profit to -7.5% loss with 1 CE extra premium.. 





profit side... 

scanerio for more than 6% , buy -3% to 2% porfit , 1 premium , profit upto 9% max extra loss of -1 to -1.5%, risk reard ratio  works .. only if loss between -%3 to -4.5% short one look feasible..  on profit side 1 to 3 chances..




loss 





Use case a:- 

go for extra presmium on sstart extra 1% mean for upto max profit extra and 1% less for max loss , if equivalent diff in max loss -mas profit make sense 


1:- go for -5 to 6  sell one day before expiry 3% extra 50%  and is does not sell it goes more than 9% works too ( make valid sense 70% risk to reward ratio)

2:- if sell premium beforre ( ### need to check formula  for out of money reatcion plus  ) 

pros:- if sell good option lock profit and if stay at same and goes otherwise

if out of money condition doers not work.. check federal and sbi entry ... (4% diff to check)

4% loss left when sell  (6%) , 

cons negation :- ,  -4 to 2 with 1.5 premium as same as  , pros :- upto -10 same things but profit locking easy and if reach max profit 3% now .. 


loss will remain same  ,

if this failes -6 to 10% preimuim changes vs new enrty is 6% out of money vs in money... 

locking the profit else leave evertyhing as its..

leave that entry add layer with smae -4 to 2  -4 to 2 with 1.5 premium , loss settle question is covered ,
