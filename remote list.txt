I led the development of data extraction and transformation processes using Python and SQL, enabling real-time customer profile updates and dynamic segmentation. I designed and implemented comprehensive loyalty programs, incorporating targeted discounts, promotions, and rewards to drive customer engagement across various channels. Additionally, I managed omnichannel marketing campaigns through a self-service platform, optimizing communications and customer interactions. By leveraging performance dashboards and reporting tools, I continuously monitored and optimized program effectiveness. I successfully launched and operationalized loyalty initiatives that strengthened customer relationships and aligned with business goals.

    ques query


    You want me to scan at least 100 sources across alteast 100 different domain sites.

The goal is to collect and rank 100 Python interview questions specifically for Data Engineers with 10+ years of experience.

Focus only on Python-related data engineering topics (e.g., ETL, pipelines, pandas, NumPy, Spark, performance tuning), from interviews conducted in the past 3 years.

You want only the questions, ranked by frequency of appearanceâ€”no answers.

Output should be delivered in a Word document. count write frequmcy ciount in bracket..
